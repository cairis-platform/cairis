Reserved characters in object names
===================================

When creating most new objects in CAIRIS, you need to provide a name.

The following characters are considered reserved and should be avoided when defining any object name: < > ' ` " \\ : % _ * / ? # £ $  
You should also avoid using any non-ASCII characters.

Although the CAIRIS GUI will disallow you from typing these reserved characters, but you can still directly paste such characters into the GUI or include them in the XML model files.
