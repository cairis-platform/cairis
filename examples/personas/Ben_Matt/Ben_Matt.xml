 <activities>Matt is a director of assurance at TeamRed LLP.  He started his career in IT around 12 years ago and, after some time working for one of the bigger consultancies, moved into penetration testing.  He has been CHECK and CREST accredited but, in recent years, has taken more responsibility for managing the penetration testing arm of his company.

Matt believes that penetration testing can be a great way of educating clients about security.  He strongly believes that fixing and limiting the scope of any engagement is a professional obligation, and he has a moral responsibility to report high impact vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.  Matt hopes that, by demonstrating this level of professionalism and recommending solid improvements as a result of any engagement, clients will develop their understanding of penetration testing as a service.</activities>
  <attitudes>Matt believes that his company’s CREST accreditations are a badge of trust, and wearing the badge means strictly adhering to the prescribed code of ethics, upholding high technical and professional standards.  Not maintaining these standards not only undermines client confidence but the entire pen testing industry.

To start building client confidence, scoping meetings are planned with a great deal of attention to detail - particularly given the risk of going out of scope and breaching the CMA.  Experience has allowed Matt to get a gut feeling of possible risks that might be present in a system at an early stage, so these meetings are used to confirm his understanding, explain potential threats, and communicate the strategy to be taken when undertaking the engagement.

When delimiting scope for legal and ethical issues, Matt finds that site visits are particularly important for red team testers.  Red team testing is highly prized because — within reason — testers are given free reign to do whatever they have to do to exploit a target.  As such, such visits help testers understand policies that might be in place, understand the limits of what is and isn’t within scope, and raise any obvious security issues they find now.  Such visits also provide cues for asking the right questions about any possible ambiguity.

Once an engagement has been concluded then Matt believes responsible clients should apply any recommendations made as soon as possible.  While Matt acknowledges their recommendations constitute advice not orders, he also believes that clients fully understand the implications of not following such as advice.  On more than one occasion, Matt has seen clients compromised because they didn’t act on recommendations given fast enough.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>As important as processes and tools are, Matt believes that experience is essential when it comes to identifying caveats to testing.  Such caveats may need to be added because information is not made available to the team, the vulnerability data available is incomplete, or there is no obvious consensus about what should be within the scope of engagement.

Matt also feels that the ability to appropriate information is key to a penetration test’s success.  In large projects, testers need to share information and findings across engagement phases, and any new vulnerabilities that are found should be shared with everyone that needs to know about them.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Managing client expectations is a key motivational driver to Matt, so much so that testers should be given coaching in this area.  Client relationships should be unbreakable, and clients should feel confident that any data or vulnerabilities collected are safeguarded, and no testing goes ahead until both testers and clients share the same understanding of what the test’s scope is.  If, for some reason, these expectations are not managed then a test’s scope can easily start to creep, as evidenced by ‘change requests’ related to scope.  Fortunately, as testing progresses, Matt finds that managing these expectations becomes easier.  As these expectations stabilise, scope creep becomes less likely, and clients gain a better understanding of what content to expect in the final report, and how to make the engagement work best for them.</motivations>
  <skills>Matt takes the view that ethics should be ‘designed out’ of any penetration testing practices, such that there should no legal or ethical dilemmas to face.  To this end, assurance is key in the processes and techniques used by testers.  A prescriptive testing methodology is enforced, and deliverables are quality controlled, such that any collected data is sanitised and all recommendations made are defensible.  To support this, Matt feels that testing interactions with 3rd parties should be signed off before any engagement begins.</skills>

<persona name="Ben" type="Primary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="Ben_portrait.jpg" >
 <!-- Image source:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/ashleymackinnon/7524751112 -->
 <activities>Ben is a CREST Registered Penetration Tester at TeamRed LLP; he has been in his current post since finishing his undergraduate degree in computing 4 years ago.  He is currently working in a team of three to carry out an infrastructure test for a regional supermarket chain; this also entails evaluating one of their mobile web apps.

Ben spends several times a week speaking with an IT team contact to explain on-going progress.  Some of this time is spent clarifying whether certain systems are within scope, and ascertaining whether certain findings of interest are a cause for concern or not.  Ben’s clients know their systems better than him, and will [justifiably] challenge concerns he raises if they don’t think assets are that important.  On the other hand, Ben also knows that uneducated clients downplay risk, and blasé clients are often slow or reluctant to make any required changes.

As the project draws, to a close, Ben will consider how best to explain fixes for any problems that are found, but IT teams don’t always like being told what they should do.  His experience is that teams distrust his unstructured approach to getting at testing targets and, as a result, is sometimes treated with suspicion and occasional passive aggressiveness - particularly if any systems fall over during testing, irrespective of whether this has anything to do with testing.</activities>
  <attitudes>Ben feels that ethics is an important soft skill.  Ben thinks that TeamRed’s code of conduct is largely common sense, but he also knows that unethical behaviour can damage his career should he lose his CREST credentials as a result of an audit by CREST or CESG.  Ben realises that any social engineering activities he undertakes can lead to ethical risks given that he is expected to do whatever he has to do to compromise a target; this can include impersonating other people.

Ben finds that working on a testing team can be difficult when the client has commissioned the test because they have to as box-ticking exercise, rather than because they want to.  Such tests are particularly difficult when systems are new and the level of accreditation isn’t clear, or the clients are focused on safeguarding proprietary information above all else.  Such clients can also complain because they don’t understand what a penetration test entails, and what everyone’s responsibilities are before, during, and after a penetration test.  This can be frustrating to Ben, particularly when his client contact is someone who is not security-savvy, or lacks the required authority to action any recommendations made.

While open hostility is rare, Ben often finds his team’s relationship with client IT ‘blue’ team can be frosty at times.  During engagements, Ben is proactive in making sure that misunderstandings do not occur due to communication problems.  For example, Ben speaks regularly to the IT teams to confirm any expected behaviour during their engagement.  While the client’s IT team may not be happy about his team’s presence, he does expect clients to remain professional during testing; this includes ensuring as few people as possible know about any ‘red team’ tests that might be underway, and ensuring that any systems being tested are not modified or made more secure during the testing process.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Ben takes his professional obligations seriously.  He is sometimes asked to help with some specific management research or collaborate on white papers.  As a result, he has some experience researching attacks from the literature, or incident reports raised by colleagues.  He keeps track of various news feeds that report new vulnerabilities or threats, and attends internal seminars given by his colleagues on different topics of interest.  Together, this research and general awareness of attacks and incidents in the wider community helps Ben understand the perspectives taken by attackers.  Where the opportunity avails itself, he shares this perspective when keeping his clients appraised of anything new that might impact a current engagement.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Ben enjoys looking at problems from the perspective of the black hat. He realises that successful attacks are the product of multiple contributing factors, and is intrigued about the different vectors taken to compromise a target system.  As Ben’s experience as grown, the more his security senses have become honed.

Because there is no ‘pen testers guide to ethics’, Ben is motivated by the need to stay within the law.  The ease within which laws can be broken is an ever present factor, as are the consequences of a criminal record to his career.  For this reason, Ben avoids undertaking any testing which is clearly out of scope or in breach of the Computer Misuse Act, and will double check any technical information provided by clients, such as IP address ranges.

Ben spent time shadowing more senior penetration testers during his initial engagements, and watching how they deal with clients during meetings and conference calls.  Now his confidence has now grown, Ben has recently became a mentor for a more junior colleague shadowing him on his current project.</motivations>
  <skills>By learning from incidents and open source reports about attacks and techniques used, Ben attempts to keep up-to-speed with the tools and technologies of black hats.  Ben is not, however, a black hat himself and is conscious of the damage to the pen testing community that might arise if people thought he was.  As a result, while Ben is free to choose the testing tools he wants, he generally relies on a toolkit of tried and tested tools, and will evaluate the output of any potential new tool before  using it on an actual engagement.  He makes notes on the usefulness and applicability of any tools he uses and/or customises.</skills>
