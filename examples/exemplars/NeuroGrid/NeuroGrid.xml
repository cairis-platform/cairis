<threat_type name="Insider/Manipulation">
  <description>Sometimes deliberate attempts are made to acquire information or access by manipulating staff by using a range of influencing techniques.  This is sometimes described as social engineering, creating situations in which someone will willingly provide access to information, sites or systems to someone unauthorised to receive it.  Customer facing personnel who have been trained to be helpful and informative can be particularly vulnerable to such attacks.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Insider/Sabotage">
  <description>Saborage is often committed by a former employee seeking revenge on their employer because of a personal grudge caused by a negative work related event such as dismissal.  Although it is sometimes planned well in advance, it can also be the result of an opportunistic moment.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Malware">
  <description>Malware is any program or file that is harmful to a computer, the term covers viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware.  Malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can be used to compromise computers to install DOS zombie programs or other malicious programs.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Hacking">
  <description>Hackers want to get into your computer system and use them for their own purposes.  There are many hacking tools available on the internet as well as online communities actively discussing hacking techniques enabling even unskilled hackers to break into unprotected systems.  Hackers have a range of motives; from showing off their technical prowess, to theft of money, credentials or information, to cause damage.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/DoS and DDoS">
  <description>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack involves a malicious attempt to disrupt the operation of a computer system or network that is connected to the Internet.  A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a more dangerous evolution of a DoS attack because it utilises a network of compromised zombie computers to mount the attack, so there is no identifiable single source.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Keystroke logging">
  <description>Keystroke loggers work by recording the sequence of key-strokes that a user types in.  The more sophisticated versions use filtering mechanisms to only record highly prized information such as email addresses, passwords and credit card number sequences.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Phishing and Spoofing">
  <description>Phishing describes a social engineering process designed to trick an organisation\'s customers into imparting confidential information such as passwords, personal data or banking and financial details.  Most commonly these are criminal attacks but the same techniques could be used by others to get sensitive information.</description>

<project_settings name="NeuroGrid data transfer" >
  <background>NeuroGrid is a project funded by the UK Medical Research Council.  The project's aim is to develop a Grid-based collaborative research environment, in order to enhance collaboration both within and between clinical researchers.

The sensitivity of this clinical data and its distributed nature drives the need to find secure and effective ways of accessing and managing it.</background>
  <strategic_goals>The high-level goal which needs to be satisfied is the secure processing of clinical data.  This involves securely uploading clinical data to NeuroGrid, which is then analysed before aggregated results can be downloaded.</strategic_goals>

  <definition>The exemplar aims to integrate large existing datasets of serial MRI scans and behaviour data coupled to the NeuroGrid image analysis service into a Grid-based database, test image normalisation techniques, and develop a general ontology for a psychosis databas, for use in multi-centre studies.

The exemplar tests capabilities of NeuroGrid to deal with restrospective data, assimilate material into databases, and use of the toolkit for normalisation and analysis.</definition>

  <definition>This exemplar aims to improve infrastructure for handling imaging in large studies including:

- efficient interpretation and storage of large image datasets from multicentre randomised controlled trials,
- very large studies of observer reliability to improve image interpretation,
- establishing large living archives of images linked to key metadata for diseases which require long term study to understand their true nature history and the effects of treatment, and
- for knowledge transfer.

The development of a structure for trial image metadata, based on a careful description of the metadata in the two exemplar trials is a key part of the project.</definition>

  <description>Yves is a high-flying post-doctoral research fellow, associated with the Stroke exemplar.  He has very limited access to NeuroGrid, but has some novel theories which could drastically cut the time take to perform clinical trials.  Yves can't wait for ethical approval to access the data he needs, so is looking at other ways of accessing clinical data sets on NeuroGrid.</description>

    <narrative>Carol gained access to the Computing Laboratory by tail-gating one of the many new DTC students arriving that day.  When she reached the attrium she asked a nearby porter for directions to the Neurosciences areas.  Carol followed the directions and eventually reached an open-plan area with a number of PCs.  The computer room is a shared work area used by the many post-docs working in the department.  Carol espied an unused PC, next to which was a man in his mid-20s who appeared to be deeply engrossed in his work. Carol approached the main and attempted to get his attention.  "Hi there", Carol said, "I'm Carol, and I'm a new post-doc in the group".  Dave looked up from his PC and smiled.  "Hi", said the over-worked post-doc, "I'm Dave.  Due mentioned something about a new post-doc.  Well, I see you found your way here ok.".  "Eventually", said Carol, "Oxford is a bit of a tardis isn't it.  Is this desk free?".  "Sure, make yourself at home", replied Dave.  Carol sat down and pulled an A4 pad and some dog-eared papers from the day-sac she had been carrying around; she wanted to give the impression she was annotating some academic papers.

After about 30 minutes, Dave sat back from his PC and sighed.  Noticing this, and sensing  an opportunity, Carol asked "Is there anywhere we can get a coffee around here?"  "You must have been reading my mind", Dave said, "Taylors is pretty good, which I'm just on my way to now - do you want to come?".

On the way to the coffee shop, Carol gave her cover story to Dave.  She was a new post-doc who had started today, but her new supervisor was away that week, she was told to just "get on with stuff" until he returned from leave.  She was obviously a bit frustrated though, as she had no login details and couldn't download any of her supervisor's previous analysis from NeuroGrid.  "No problem", said Dave, "I'll just log you in when we get back, and I'll give you a copy of my NeuroGrid certificate on a USB stick".  On their return, Dave logged Carol into the guest PC and gave her the certificate as promised.  For the rest of the day, Carol surfed the web until about 7pm when Dave went home.  When she was sure the office was empty, Carol took out her camera and took several shots of the PC, with the login screen of the NeuroGrid portal clearly visible.  She then scribbled down the events of the day on her A4 pad before leaving the building to catch the Oxford Tube back to London.</narrative>

    <narrative>Yves knew for sometime that Sally had access to a data-set he needed to finish off a trial in time for that journal submission deadline.  However, due to administrative overhead of obtaining ethical approval, Yves never got around to applying for access to that data-set himself.  Besides, he was so busy doing research, where was he going to get the time to drop everything to fill in the necessary paperwork.  He, therefore, decide to progress his research and deal with getting the data he needed precisely when he needed it.

"Aaarrgghh" cried Yves.  "What's up", asked Sally from the other end of the open-plan office they shared.  "I'm missing several samples of data from that batch of images we got from the Phillipines last week", said Yves.
Sally came over and looking at the workflow results on Yves screen.  "Ah", said Sally, "I think the data is there but you just don't have access to it."  "What!" exclaimed Yves, "I was told I had everything I needed from Mike, why didn't he tell me I was missing images from this data set.  How am I supposed to submit this paper by the end of the week without a complete validation".  Yves put his head in his hands.

"You know what", said Sally, "I think I've got access to that data.  Why don't you just login as me and resubmit your workflow that way".
Yves perked up; "Sally, you're a star", Yves said, "you've just earned yourself some drinks and a paper acknowledgement.".

Sally walked back to her desk, copied her digital certificate to a USB stick, before walking back to Yves to hand over the key.  "Ta", said Yves, before loading the digital certificate to his web-browser, logging back into NeuroGrid, and re-submitting his workflow. </narrative>

    <narrative>Several weeks ago, Mallory installed a rootkit on a PC in the UK which happened to be used to access NeuroGrid.  While examining the PC recently, Mallory noticed certain characteristics of the PC suggesting that this machine was being used to access a computational grid.

After setting up a packet sniffer to monitor traffic, Mallory spotted the potential for a replay attack which could be reproduced from several different machines.  Mallory subsequently wrote a script and ran it from a different machine using the same root certificate.  It worked!  Mallory now had a way of uploading workflows on demand to NeuroGrid - useful for any high-intensive processing needing to be carried out, such as breaking symmetric encryption.</narrative>

    <narrative>Alice was in a hurry.  She desparately had to catch that 10.15 train to London but she didn't have time to go all the way back to the Comlab to download the latest analysis results - results she needed for the presentation she was giving at UCL. As she crossed Hythe Bridge, Alice remembered that there was a cheap call shop near the chinese supermarket; perhaps they had internet access.  Alice hurried into the shop and noticed a bank of PCs by the far wall.

After enquiring about the use of a PC, Alice was told it would be 5 pounds for 30 minutes use.  She only needed the machine for about 5 minutes but her need was urgent so she paid up and hurried over to the nearest PC.   Alice reached for her USB stick, transferred her root certificate to the machine, logged into the NeuroGrid portal, downloaded her results from her WebDAV folder, before transferring them to his USB stick.  After glancing nervously at her watch, she pulled out his USB, closed the web-browser down and walked briskly out of the shop and towards the station.  Perhaps she might make that train after all.

Two hours later, and several hundred miles away, Mallory checked his bot herd status logs.  It looks like he was the proud owner of 10 new PCs.  Mallory ran the machine inventory script of his new prizes, and noticed that one of them had earlier access the NeuroGrid portal.  "Yes!" Mallory exclaimed to himself as he checked the browser cache and found an elusive digital certificate.  As Mallory transferred this certificate to his machine, ensuring afterwards it was removed from the newly owned PC at the internet cafe in Oxford, he could only wonder at the processing power now made available to him.</narrative>

<persona name="Claire" type="Primary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="" >
  <activities>Claire is a clinical researcher within the Psychosis exemplar.  She is responsible for a group which is developing and testing processing pipelines for harmonising MRI images from different centres.

Claire authorises requests that other members of her group make for accessing NeuroGrid, and is officially responsible for making sure her colleagues aren't misusing their access.  In practice, however, she delegates much of her responsibility to one of her more security-knowledgeable colleagues.</activities>
  <attitudes>Claire feels that NeuroGrid has a lot to offer her research but, right now, its hard to see the benefits for the usability problems she faces.

Although Claire appreciates the importance of security and the confidentialty of her research subjects, authorising colleague requests for data access and liasing with the infrastructure team is a time consuming process which isn't helping her get any research done.

Claire is also perplexed at why security could cause simple workflows take such a long time to run, but she also remembers how long it used to take to get data before NeuroGrid so she can live with the performance issues.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Claire and her colleagues follow a set of processes and guidelines when working with data uploaded to NeuroGrid.

Because obtaining data is an expensive business, Claire also tries to reuse data and analysis as much as possible, and as far as her ethics clearance allows.

</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Besides her research, Claire's primary security concerns are centered around the datasets she maintains, and making sure her colleagues and collaborators can access the data they need. </motivations>

  <activities>Tom is an applications developer within the Stroke exemplar.

Tom collaborates with a his clinical researchers colleagues as part of a number of on-going trials to support their research work.  This includes anonymises images, and uploads these to NeuroGrid.</activities>
  <attitudes>Tom is aware that some of his users find security painful, and he believes that a usable system will eventually lead to a secure system as well.  Having fielding questions from his users about NeuroGrid, Tom has found that when users understand why things are the way they are, NeuroGrid makes a bit more sense.

Tom is, however, aware that medical researchers sometimes have their rules about what should and shouldn't be secured which can be source of annoyance to him.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Nothing stipulated</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Tom feels responsible for making sure that users can't do anything damaging - either to their research or system security in general.

Tom also wants security to be practical.  Tom shares the infrastructure team's view on the importance of network security, and believes that, if left up to his users alone, that nothing will ever be agreed.  Consequently, Tom is happy to work with whatever security controls are mandated.</motivations>

Matt is also the designated NeuroGrid Certificate Authority and, as such, is often the first line for users in all exemplars if there are NeuroGrid access problems.  As the infrastructure team are also responsible for maintaining the NeuroGrid access control policies, Matt also helps data owners craft the fine grained policies controlling access to managed datasets.</activities>

  <excerpt>The third thing I've come to realise is that actually a lot of people who own their own data, don't care about security.

In NeuroGrid, there is a means of tying individuals down and we can say "X can only see this data".

<document_reference name="Disclosure of medical data causes an outcry." contributor="SF" document="Asset sensitivity GT concept" >
  <excerpt>When you are working with medical data, if you have a security issue with medical data and it gets to the press, it can cause some major problems.

Just from looking at historical cases, where members of the public have found things out they didn't like about themselves, their friends or their family, or even in just the way the data was used, or just the fact that somebody got access to the data.

It wouldn't even matter if they could do anything with the data, the fact that it can happen can cause the media to have an outcry, as this can sell papers.

That sort of thing can shut down projects fairly rapidly.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Data access locked down if security concerns." contributor="SF" document="Asset sensitivity GT concept" >
  <excerpt>They obviously wanted their data to be secure and it was fairly high up in the list of priorities of people I spoke to.

This was particularly the case for psychosis, but that was understandable given that a lot of their patients had criminal records and other likely secondary problems.

There was a police involvement usually in their cases and there is a delicate area for funding.

They said at one point that if there was any problem with security, we could be quite sure that we wouldn't get access.

Especially as the legislation at the time involved sectioning of schizophrenics and things like this.

This was a serious concern for them.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Patient data should not get into NeuroGrid" contributor="SF" document="Asset sensitivity GT concept" >
  <excerpt>For us, being involved in clinical trials, the principle concern is simply that no patient data gets out.

By getting out, this means into NeuroGrid.

A lot of what we have to do to protect patient data has nothing to do with NeuroGrid per se, it's all things we have to do up-front before it ever goes out.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Middleware security is taken seriously" contributor="SF" document="Control sensitivity GT concept" >
  <excerpt>in terms of our middleware - data transport, facilitating secure access, managing user credentials and that kind of stuff, we take this really seriously.

This has been the one great driver for us as a lot of grid middleware started out as being about computational grids, and managing workflows and jobs for physicists.

In SOMEPROJECT, we came to the conclusion that the middleware wasn't fit for purpose and our focus has always been data and about data.  

That is why we abandoned GT3 and did our own thing, as we have very clear requirements with respect to security and interoperability and all these other things.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Security designed in line with functionality" contributor="SF" document="Control sensitivity GT concept" >
  <excerpt> It was designed literally from the first as it was all web service base.

Because of this, literally from the first web service that was written, security was put in.

We worried about how to make it secure first and we built the system second.

SF: How was security put in in that sense?

<document_reference name="Technology and institutions constrain data transfers between universities." contributor="SF" document="Control sensitivity GT concept" >
  <excerpt>One of the problems with universities is trying to transfer data between universities can be pretty difficult.

So, you've got large amount of information, scans which take up gigabytes of information, and you have to try and transfer that.  

You've got the restrictions of what may or may not be suitable and then you've got, in terms of technical limitations, how you can transfer data.  

You then need to come up with methods that are secure, so if the data fell into someone else's hands then it wouldn't be useful for them.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Context for control is not always clear." contributor="SF" document="Control usability GT concept" >
  <excerpt>When you are asked for a password, you need to know which password is being asked for.  When you have more than one password and a certificate, you begin to wonder whether they are asking for the certificate or do they ask for the password ; what is it they want to know?  </excerpt>

  <excerpt>If they do, then it is important to let me know.

The worse thing is when you try something out and it doesn't work, you ask yourself: did I do something wrong or is the system not working?

In the beginning, it was an issue that lots of things didn't work, as the system was still in the process of being built up, so it couldn't work straight away.</excerpt>

  <excerpt>When you get an error message, you want that error message explained.

When I first used the network I didn't know whether I was doing something wrong, or if the system was not working yet.

Without any feedback there was nothing I could do.  

This is why I said earlier that the easiest solution was to try things out and then go on the phone and ask [A] to get feedback straight away.  

For example, the data in Oxford is used in a compressed form, i.e. nii.gz format.  

When I uploaded my data and it didn't work, I was told that I must use an uncompressed version.  

Without asking anyone, how was I supposed to know this?</excerpt>

  <excerpt>The complication for security would be the truststores.

These Java truststores (or keystores) are strange beasts.

That is what we use in the server to decide whether we like a certificate or not.

We see if it is trusted by the truststore.

The users also have truststores to talk to.

If it's going to go wrong, that is usually where the problems are.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Users appreciate getting data without waiting weeks." contributor="SF" document="Control usability GT concept" >
  <excerpt>They know that if they want this data from any other sources, it takes days and days.

For example, someone within another project asked us to send them some anonymised data they could find within the NeuroGrid project if they had access to.i

At the time they didn't have that access, so it took weeks and weeks to get the data on a DVD, encode it, post it to them, when it arrived, they had to call us for the password, so they know that having access to this kind of data is a big issue.

They appreciate it even if it takes an hour to get the data, but as a general rule if it takes more than one minute for a query, then something is wrong.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Users unaccustomed to installing certificates." contributor="SF" document="Control usability GT concept" >
  <excerpt>The problem is that people are not accustomed to installing certificates inside their browser.

Usually, we see some people who are very eager to use the portal and after a while, when you ask them "what happened, I don't see you using the portal", as you can't see their usage from the log files, they say "well, I tried it but it didn't allow me to access it".  

Some people who go to the support page and see the screenshots explaining things step-by-step, showing how you have to download a file, upload it into your browser, etc - it seems a bit unfamiliar to people.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Usernames and passwords more familiar to users than certificates." contributor="SF" document="Control usability GT concept" >
  <excerpt>At the beginning, we were thinking that as an API user, username and password is much more common so maybe it would have been more automated if the people could use username and password on the portal and, based on that username and password, when we could recognise them, we could use a certificate for them internally.  </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Certificates are frightening users away from the portal." contributor="SF" document="Control usability GT concept" >
  <excerpt>We could have a bank of certificates automatically generated for every user and we could do this behind the scene so every transaction over the net is still secured, but users are not hassled by the certificate.

Maybe "hassled" isn't the right word, but that actually is frightening many users from using the portal.

When we explain the benefits of using certificates and when they install it, it is easy for them to use it.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Users keep non temporary data in temp folders." contributor="SF" document="Control usability GT concept" >
  <excerpt>When we came to usability, we recognised that people who use the system tend to keep the files as on the temp folder more than 24 hours.

They download files, they put them on the temp folder, they use them as an input to workflows and keep the output from the workflows there.

They tend to use it as one of their folders.</excerpt>

  <excerpt>The biggest problem on NeuroGrid testing the portal was that it was security was too strict.

People didn't access it.

Clinicians weren't going to download a certificate and email for a password.

So, they didn't access the portal, so the requirements came quite late for that.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Clinician perception that security took too much time." contributor="SF" document="Control usability GT concept" >

<document_reference name="Developers may potentially publish confidential information." contributor="SF" document="Delegated control responsibility GT concept" >
  <excerpt>The real reason that would be useful is that it would extend the ability of the NeuroGrid system to be used by other programming languages and other web services frameworks.

It doesn't have any ramifications re: security per se.

In fact, you could argue that a two-speed setup like that might open the way for someone in my position, who wasn't paying attention to what he was doing, to potentially publish confidential information on the wire. </excerpt>

When you explain that it is just a directory on the web, they go ah.

It's just a name, but if you aren't an expert, you don't know if it is a technical term which means something you need to know about or not.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Portal is a frame of reference" contributor="SF" document="Engagement artifact GT concept" >
  <excerpt>It isn't until you get the actual basic portal... I like what [E] said, in that you've got to give them something to hate - something real and tangible, a vehicle for engagement.  As soon as you have something, people won't say what they did want.

They will automatically say what they didn't want like you can't have this and you shouldn't have the other.

The requirements then became very obvious and there was a common frame of reference.

Having an early form of portal as a vehicle was terrifically useful.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Metaphors helped people express ideas." contributor="SF" document="Engagement artifact GT concept" >
  <excerpt>There were lots of issues where people couldn't express it before as they didn't know what things were called.

For example, the WebDAV folder kept cropping up and confusing people, so when they saw the prototype they said: Oh that! That's just an ordinary folder.

The security discussions came up because people couldn't access it really.

In a sense, the security was too good.</excerpt>

Is there any guidance which says that you can't use this system in an internet cafe, or is it safe to say you wouldn't want to do it, but there is nothing in the rules you have which says that you can't?

I2: I'm not entirely sure, but I don't think it says anywhere.

This needs to be pointed out.  It is difficult from a technical point of view, as the internet itself is safe and when I, with my own laptop, go to an insecure web-page, then I still have access as it all goes via my laptop.  </excerpt>

If there is a bug in security, this will be of concern.  

We need to use the most update version of, for example, web services.

If you are connecting to my service which is using Apache Tomcat.

If Apache Tomcat has a bug, then obviously we have a problem.

Every week, I am checking to make sure I am using the latest version.

On the security side at Oxford, I'm sure they are doing the same thing.</excerpt>

You have the physical security of the servers.

There is one here our images are stored on that can be accessed by NeuroGrid from any points on the grid.

The others are doing the same.

In our case, we would never have confidential information on that machine.

This organisation, [B], there are any number of trials which have nothing to do with NeuroGrid/the stroke exemplar, that are going on.

So, there is an SOP for handling patient data.  

It touches on a lot of areas which are irrelevant for NeuroGrid, as we are focusing purely on the imaging data.

There is a much larger set of data on the patients themselves, the hospitals they were treated at, the treatment they got, basic demographics, outcomes.

All these things are kept completely separately in separate databases out of our control.

Mostly the SOPs are oriented around that.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Institutions have some responsibility for server security." contributor="SF" document="Institutional responsibility GT concept" >
  <excerpt>There is a small amount of responsibility with the institutions participating because NeuroGrid is secured over a set of nodes, just a set of servers, in different physical locations.

We have one here.

So, there is some small responsibility we have.

The responsibility locally is don't mess that up.</excerpt>

That is housing the server, doing its backups,  doing disaster recovery if anything went wrong.

The backups are stored off-site but we just leave all that...

They also, all users, are responsible for signing a code of practice.

This is basically computer use or computer misuse.

We see it as our job to tell them what the problem is and to remind them that they are the PI so if something goes wrong it is definitely on their hands.

It depends on what your background is when you make an application for ethical approval.

It tends to depend on how broad and general the ethical approval is.

So, medics making ethical approvals tend to get a fairly broad sweep of who can access the data ; they get quite a lot of latitude on who they allow to access the data.

<document_reference name="Agreeing by predicting was wrong." contributor="SF" document="Requirements perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>It was just a case of getting people to agree on what they want in this database, to try to predict what kind of research they would try to be doing in the next year, or the next several years.

It was just the wrong way to do things.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Infrastructure concerns are straightforward." contributor="SF" document="Requirements perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>As far as we're concerned, at our level it is relatively straightforward; "we have some data, let's move it around".  Higher up, the more interesting stuff about what people do with that data, that was going to be taken care of by a workflow toolkit.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Teams do not know what they wanted." contributor="SF" document="Requirements perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>It is slightly difficult for the computing team at Oxford as they are trying to get us what we want, and we don't exactly know what it is we want.

Sometimes that geographical distance and sometimes just working in different teams means that it takes time for them to get an understanding of what we want, and for us to get an understanding of what we want and be able to communicate that effectively. </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Projects initially asked what assets they had." contributor="SF" document="Requirements perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>We asked the questions in the early days about security, which we've asked on all projects.

These are "what assets have you got?" and "what constraints do you want to put on those assets?"</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Perceived workflows of what the system could provide varied." contributor="SF" document="Requirements perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>We got them to draw up workflow and document what they thought the system could provide for them.

This varied from somewhere just to run your image analysis techniques to "we want it to be our data archive", which came as a bit of a shock when we responded with "that's now possible, we can't be available 24-7 and hold your primary source of data for clinical trials - that's not what the grid is about".</excerpt>

</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Specific steps are followed for anonymising data." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture norms GT concept" >
  <excerpt>The first part is can any data be exported at all.

Behind the scene, all this imaging data is kept in a local archive and the people who manage the archive carry out preliminary steps to limit the amount of patient data that can be correlated to the images themselves.

It is hard to say what the DICOM files might contain, so you have to be fairly strict about getting rid of stuff, as there are all kinds of variation about format.

One file might contain a patient's name, or the physician's name, or the radiographer's name.

So, there is a preliminary step, which is done by the people who manage the archive.

When it becomes time to actually export it from outside, to go outside our firewall, that is where I come in and that is where NeuroGrid is affected.  </excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="All exemplar sites have agreed anonymisation rules." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture norms GT concept" >
  <excerpt>we came up with a set of rules of our own.

The stroke exemplar covers two institutions ; there is this group here in Edinburgh and there is another group at the University of Nottingham.

It all comes down to anonymising the files, so we have agreed what our anonymisation rules will be and everybody signed off.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Security conscious users craft solid policies." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture perception GT concept" >

<document_reference name="Data sensitive users refuse algorithmic workflow access." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>In NeuroGrid, they brought together three groups of people who had radically different views on security and different types of data.

We have one person whose data is all about potential schizophrenics.

That is very sensitive data as a lot of these people aren't schizophrenics but have a very high probability of becoming one.

That is bad information to get out into the field because of insurance issues or because people won't employ them.

So, his ethics are very strict to the extent that he never wanted his data to leave the server.  He would only allow processed results to leave.

As it turned out, the whole workflow side of the project never happened as you can't run an algorithm across his data, but he was really pushing for ultra-strict security where you would have to process the data to such an extent that it was useless for identification, whereas other people put data on the system and don't care who sees it.

The fact that it was a closed group of only 40 people, who would be happy to turn all the access control off if they could.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Security conscious users reluctant to provide access." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture perception GT concept" >
  <excerpt>For example, because of the nature of the images owned by psychosis exemplar, they are very reluctant, correctly, to release their images.

So, getting access to their node is very difficult, as they don't want to release their images.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Some users focus only on secure data transfer." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture perception GT concept" >

</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Some users will reuse study data for another." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture values GT concept" >
  <excerpt>I was once at a meeting where it was apparent that once the data is collected, people decide they want to use it for another study.

This could go beyond what the patient signed for.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Remit of data sometimes go further than originally agreed." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture values GT concept" >
  <excerpt>I went to one of these meetings and there was a problem, which had nothing to do with MRI imaging, where some data was given that may have been used for something like an abortion.

The person who gave that data might be a Christian who certainly doesn't want this.

This is an example of an instance where the remit has gone further than that originally specified and people who gave their consent might have said they wouldn't give their consent. </excerpt>

<document_reference name="People fight their own project corners" contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture values GT concept" >

<document_reference name="Doctors want scans and data in an easily accessible way." contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture values GT concept" >
  <excerpt>From an NHS side, as a doctor, it would be great to have scans and data in an easily accessible way, as that's the best for the patients.

We are stopped from doing this for the patients as there are people who would like to get hold of this data.

There is that conflict.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="infrastructure not funded by clinical trials" contributor="SF" document="Sub-culture values GT concept" >

  <excerpt>These are not IT specialists, they are scientists and not experts in computing.

<document_reference name="Shortcuts taken to move data quicker." contributor="SF" document="Security erosion GT concept" >
  <excerpt> I think one of the problems when you've got lots of universities and different institutions is that they all have their own frameworks and guidelines in place for managing data securely.

I think that sometimes it would be much easier if there was a broad consensus if people did things in a similar way and there was an appreciation that data needs to be transferred between sites and this needs to be enabled more easily.

I think one of the dangers is that short-cuts are taken as things are so difficult that people say well it's going to be too difficult to go through this entire process, we need the data more quickly.

I don't think we've had that, but I foresee that happening if there was real pressure.

For example, at one of the sites we did have a delay in getting started and it did get completed very quickly.

Had it not then we could have run into problems trying to cut through red-tape in order to transfer data securely.

You can imagine a situation where someone says look we just need the data to do this so let's just take a short cut.

I guess that sort of idea of collaboration given more consideration, so data can be transferred around more easily, with the necessary safeguards in place. </excerpt>

  <excerpt>When their workloads are so huge, the first thing they've got to do is make sure those patients get their results back.

If there is anything standing in their way, they will try and by-pass it.  

It's not unknown for clinics, hospitals and GP practices for people to share user ids and get onto systems, as the first concern is to get things done.

They can't wait for people like system administrators to do things like change access rights.  </excerpt>

<document_reference name="Users email for a certificate when data owners grant access to the data." contributor="SF" document="Socialisation GT concept" >
  <excerpt>I think they would have to send an email to [C] to get a certificate for themselves, after us saying it's ok for them to have access to our data.

They literally give them a certificate to give them access to NeuroGrid and then they should get access to our data.

It should be that simple I think.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Users are authorised by an exemplar sponsor." contributor="SF" document="Socialisation GT concept" >
  <excerpt>Normally, they will need sponsorship from one of the exemplars, there is Dementia, Stroke and Psychosis ; there is an investigator for each exemplar.

So, to begin with, they will need to be authorised by that person.

At that point, we can give them a certificate to access the system and we will probably discuss with the data owner any ramifications about what access they should have and that kind of thing.

We then give them a certificate and some instructions and they are on their way.</excerpt>

<document_reference name="Users need to have technical ability to use the applications." contributor="SF" document="Socialisation GT concept" >
  <excerpt>Most of what we develop is designed to be used by technical people developing end-user applications.

It is not designed for end-users to use.

So, it is reasonable to expect that the people we are developing for has a certain amount of technical ability and to be able to understand how to use the APIs we provide and the sample code we gave them.</excerpt>
</document_reference>
<document_reference name="Guest certificates provided as obtaining personal certificates is too cumbersome." contributor="SF" document="Socialisation GT concept" >
  <excerpt>The reason we have the guest certificate is that the process of obtaining the personal certificate was very difficult as it involved you calling people in Oxford.

They send a certificate over email, but they don't send the password.

You have to call them, or you have to setup a secure email account.

In both cases this is difficult.

We had people on the NeuroGrid project where, after a year or so, said "we never go around to calling Douglas to get the password, so we lost the password and we don't know what it is".  </excerpt>
