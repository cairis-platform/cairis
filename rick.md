## Narrative

#### Activities

Rick is a clean-water plant operator, responsible for ensuring that
water processed through the plant is in line with specified set-points.
Rick's area of responsibility extend outside of the confines of the
plant to include checking on pumping stations, which feed water into the
plant's nearby reservoir.

During his working shifts (he works a 5 + 1 continental shift), Rick
frequently checks readings on his SCADA workstation, takes water samples
at various locations around the plant, and responds to alarms raised by
the SCADA system; if necessary this involves investigating problems,
and -- if no remedial tasks are possible -- calling someone out to
investigate further.

At the start of every shift, Rick checks AJS to see what work he is
scheduled to carry out. He usually updates AJS based on the work he
carried out before the end of his shift. Rick also maintains a paper
work diary, which is updated after carrying out specific work or
responding to problems. This, together with the status white board, is
also useful for explaining any on-going issues when handing over to the
next shift.

#### Attitudes

Rick isn't particularly concerned about people trying to hack into the
SCADA system he uses. "The only way the SCADA will get infected", Rick
says, "is by an instrument tech plugging a virus infected laptop into
it".

Rick is aware of Information Security communiques on InfoPortal, but
doesn't see how this is relevant to him. "We don't have laptops", says
Rick, "and we don't leave site, so we don't leave anything in cars".
Rick is, however, aware of Information Security controls. Rick knows
that logout policies keep intruders from getting access to his
workstation (although he thinks the logout period is too short given his
environment), and he knows he can only access certain pumping sites via
the telemetry system.

Although Rick can call an instrument tech for many problems, experience
has taught him not to expect much from the ACME ICT support during a
night shift. "What's the point of calling up to say you can't login at
night if all you get is a reference number", Rick complains, "that won't
help me start my pumps now!" Although Rick knows he can call out an
instrument tech to help, he is also conscious that they are out most
evenings, and might not appreciate a call-out for a corporate ICT
problem.

#### Aptitudes

Rick has been a plant operator for over 10 years. Although the exact
procedures need to run his plant are documented in a works manual, he
doesn't need to refer to it. "I haven't read the works manual in years",
Rick says.

This experience does not stay in Rick's head. When problems have
occurred, he raises these during team meetings, and any lessons learned
sometimes find their way into the SCADA system as new functionality.
Rick is aware of the new EnterpriseSCADA developments and possible
improvements to the HMI and start-up procedure. Although not fully in
the loop about what is going on, he hopes that, like the current system,
there will be productivity improvements without an adverse impact.

Rick uses the SCADA's trend monitoring facilities as a indication of
possible problems. "If the trends freeze or flat-line", Rick says, "I
need to go out and take a look at what's wrong". Because problems occur
daily, and he is often on his own, Rick can still control the plant
using panel PCs at remote locations around the plant.

#### Motivations

Because the water quality can change over a matter of minutes, Rick's
ethos is that you need to be ready for anything. Because of this,
checking certain parameters and pieces of kit is an important
discipline, as is logging important events in the works diary and on the
status board; these aid communication to other shift members, and the
eventual piecing together of the elements of an event.

Although information security doesn't phase Rick too much, personal
security does. Potentially facing off a scrap metal thief is a big worry
for Rick. "The police don't respond to intruder alarms at a nearby
pumping station any more due to false alarms", says Rick. "Because of
this, we've been told not to go out to these places on our own. We have
a lone-worker system when people call us when we get to a particular
station, but what happens if we get problems on the way?"

#### Skills

Rick has a basic operating knowledge of Windows; enough to carry out his
day-to-day routines, check his email, and navigate the main sections of
InfoPortal.

Rick isn't a power-user; he acknowledges that younger "whizz kids" are
much more adept at using PCs than he is. Consequently, he only uses a
sub-set of the desktop icons currently on his desktop. "I don't know
what these other applications do", Rick says,"I've tried clicking on one
and it just gives me a Data Protection Warning. I guess this means I'm
not authorised to use it."
