## Overview ##

Attackers launch attacks in the form of threats. Attackers are similar to personas in that fulfil one or more roles, and can be personalised with additional information.

Certain capabilities and motivations may be associated with attackers.  CAIRIS is pre-loaded with a selection of these, but these can be modified, or new capabilities and motivations created by selecting the Options/Capabilities or Options/Motivations menu options.

### Adding, updating, and deleting an attacker ###

* Click on the Attacker toolbar button to open the Attackers dialog box, and click on the Add button to open the Attacker dialog box.

* Enter the attacker name, and a description for the attacker.

* If you have decided to personalise the attacker with a picture, this can be added by right clicking on photo box next to the attacker description, to bring up the Load Image option from the speed menu, and selecting Load Image.  Please note that the image itself is NOT imported into the database, only the file path to the picture.

* Right click on the environment window to bring up the environment speed menu.  Select the add option and, from the Add environment window, select an environment to situate the attacker in.  This will add the new environment to the environment list.

* After ensuring the environment is selected in the environment window, right-click on the Roles list, and select Add from the speed menu to associate one or more roles to the attacker.  

* Right-click on the Motive and Capability boxes and select Add to add one or more motive and capability values.  For the capabilty, a value of Low, Medium, or High also needs to be selected.  

* Click on the Create button to add the new attacker.

* Existing attackers can be modified by double clicking on the attacker in the Attackers dialog box, making the necessary changes, and clicking on the Update button.

* To delete an attacker, select the attacker to delete in the Attackers dialog box, and select the Delete button.  If any artifacts are dependent on this attacker then a dialog box stating these dependencies are displayed.  The user has the option of selecting Yes to remove the attacker dependencies and the attacker itself, or No to cancel the deletion.
