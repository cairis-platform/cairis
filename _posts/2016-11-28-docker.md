## The CAIRIS Docker container ##

We're pleased to announce that a CAIRIS web app container is now available for download from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/).  You can find the container [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/shamalfaily/cairis/).


## What is Docker? ##

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a platform that allows you to run *containerised* applications.  In the case of CAIRIS, downloading and running the CAIRIS container means that all you need to do is [follow our instructiond](http://cairis.org/install/#web-application), point your web browser to the appropriate URL exposed by the container, and you're ready to go.  

## Two words of warning before you start ##

* The container is based on the latest development version of CAIRIS on github. 

* This container is great for evaluating/playing with CAIRIS but is not for operational use.  The team is evaluating a more robust deployment option based on [mod_wsgi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mod_wsgi), so look forward to incremental improvements towards a production-ready container for general use.

## Bugs / Requests / Suggestions ##

As always we welcome your feedback.  Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/failys/cairis/issues) if you find any problems or have specific features/suggestions you would like to see incorporated.
