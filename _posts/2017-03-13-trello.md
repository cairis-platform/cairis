## Creating Personas using the Persona Helper, CAIRIS, and Trello ##

![Trello]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cairis_goal_model.pdf)

To help automate the process of creating personas, we've just included the ability to export document references to, and lists from [Trello](https://trello.com).  

When used in conjunction with [the Persona Helper](http://cairis.org/cairis/personahelper/), this provides the ability to elicit factoids from online data, and facilitates the construction of online affinity diagrams. These diagrams form the basis of persona characteristics in CAIRIS.

For more information about this functionality, please take a look at the [video demo](https://vimeo.com/208162116).
