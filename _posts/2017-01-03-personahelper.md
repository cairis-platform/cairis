## The Persona Helper ##

![PersonaHelperCWS]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/persona_helper_cws.pdf)

We're pleased to announce that we have just released the [Persona Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/persona-helper/mhojpjjecjmdbbooonpglohcedhnjkho) Chrome Extension.  

The extension allows designers to quickly elicit factoids from web pages, and use them to ground persona characteristics within CAIRIS.  

The extension is free to download and use, and the source code for the Persona Helper is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/failys/persona_helper).  


## Before you start ##

* The extension relies on the 'test' session that comes with default CAIRIS installation. Later versions will support authentication with CAIRIS, so only legitimate users will be able to add factoids.

## Bugs / Requests / Suggestions ##

Please raise an [issue](https://github.com/failys/persona_helper/issues) if you find any problems, or write a review on the Chrome Web Store if you have specific features/suggestions you would like to see incorporated into the extension.
