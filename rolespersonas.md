## Roles ##

Roles represent the abstract classes representing human agents; these also encapsulate behaviours and responsibilities.  CAIRIS supports 2 types of role: stakeholder and attacker.  Stakeholder roles represent human agents the system needs to be directly, or indirectly designed for.  Attackers are human agents the system should not be designed for.

### Adding, updating, and deleting a role ###

* Click on the Role toolbar button to open the Roles dialog box, and click on the Add button to open the Role dialog box.

* Enter a role name and description, and select the role type.

* Click on the Update button  to Add the new role to the CAIRIS database.

* As responses and countermeasures are assigned to roles, the Role dialog is automatically updated to reflect these new dependencies.  These dependencies can not be modified from the Role dialog.

* Existing roles can be modified by double clicking on the role in the Roles dialog box, making the necessary changes, and clicking on the Update button.

* To delete a role, select the role to delete in the Roles dialog box, and select the Delete button.  If any artifacts are dependent on this role then a dialog box stating these dependencies are displayed.  The user has the option of selecting Yes to remove the role dependencies and the role itself, or No to cancel the deletion.

### Responsibility modelling ###

Responsibility models can be viewed by clicking on the View Responsibility Model toolbar button, and selecting the environment to view the environment for.

By changing the environment name in the environment combo box, the responsibility model for a different environment can be viewed.  The layout of the model can also be replaced by selecting a layout option in the Layout combo box at the foot of the model viewer window.

By clicking on a model element, information about that artifact can be viewed.  

## Personas ##

Personas are specifications of archetypical users that the system needs to directly or indirectly cater for.
The system needs to be specified for Primary Personas, but Secondary Personas cannot be ignored as their thoughts or concerns provide insight into potential usability problems.

### Adding, updating, or deleting a persona ###

### Recording persona assumptions ###

![fig:APModel]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/APModel.png "Assumption Persona model")

* From the Options/External Document directory, click on the Add button and add information about the source of any assumptions external to CAIRIS.  An example of such an *External Document* might be an interview transcript.  Alternatively, if assumptions are purely based on your own thoughts and feelings then an External Document can be created to make this explicit.

* Open up the Persona dialog for the persona you want to add a characteristic to, and right click in the behavioural variable folder (e.g. Activities) you wish to add a Characteristic to.

* From the Persona Characteristics dialog box, click on Add to add a new characteristic.

* From the General folder, add a description of the characteristic and a *Model Qualifier*; this word describes your confidence in the validity of the characteristic.  Possible qualifiers might include *always*, *usually*, or *perhaps*.

* Click on the Grounds tab to open the list of Grounds for this characteristic.  The grounds are evidence which support the validity of the characteristic.  Right click in the Reference box, and select Add to add a Document Reference.  Select the concept type for this evidence and the name of a pre-exising concept or document reference for this grounds.  If one doesn't already exist, then select any artifact and, from the Reference combo box, select [New artifact reference] (for a document reference) or [New concept reference] (for a reference to an existing model object.  In both cases, a dialogue box will appear allowing you to enter a short description of the grounds proposition, together with more detailed rationale.  Clicking on Ok will add the new document or concept reference, and add this to the grounds list.

* Click on the Warrant tab to open the list of Warrants for this characteristic.  The warrants are inference rules which links the grounds to the characteristic.  The procedure for adding warrants is identical to the process for adding grounds.  After adding a warrant, however, a Backing entry for the warrant is automatically added.

* If you wish to add a Rebuttal -- a counterargument for the characteristic -- then click on the Rebuttals tab and add a rebuttal using the same procedure for Grounds and Warrants.

* Click on the Create button to create the new characteristic.

* Existing characteristics can be modified by double clicking on the characteristics in the Persona Characteristic dialog box, making the necessary changes, and clicking on the Edit button.
