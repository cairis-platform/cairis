# ACME Water

<h2>Background</h2>

The security of the environment around Control Systems, operational personnel, sites, assets, activities, information, technological resources, and services has taken on increased importance at ACME Water for the following reasons:

* The disappearing network boundary: a highly mobile workforce works on assets and systems deployed over a diverse and challenging geographic terrain.  Information Technology enables this but, in doing so, needs to provide controlled access to core applications, allowing multiple protocols access through the perimeter, reducing perimeter controls, allowing partners to deliver contractual obligations on time and to cost.
* The business climate is highly regulated, and delivery of Wastewater and Cleanwater services are critical to our customers.  It is imperative ACME employees are made aware of the importance of protecting our assets, information, and reputation to meet this end.
* Law requires companies to institute reasonable, effective and consistent controls designed to prevent the disclosure and falsification of information, the safety of personnel, sites, and the protection of technological resources.
* Rapid changes face ACME in the use and dependence of computers and network technologies.  It is necessary and reasonable to expect everyone to apply the proper methods of handling and safeguarding information, and managing computer and network resources.

<h2>Goal</h2>

To provide a secure operating environment for SCADA, Telemetry and Control Systems associated with assets owned and operated by ACME.

<h2>Scope</h2>

All ICT infrastructure in support of Enterprise SCADA, Telemetry and Control Systems indicated in the rich picture.
