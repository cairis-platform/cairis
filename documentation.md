The current contents of the CAIRIS database can be generated as a requirements specification by selecting the Generate Documentation toolbar button.  After the sections to be included are selected in the Generate Documentation dialog box (figure [fig:GenerateDocumentationDialog]), the target directory is prompted, following which the specification is generated as HTML, RTF, or PDF, based on the output options selected.
