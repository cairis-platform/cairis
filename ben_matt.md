#### Activities

Ben is a CREST Registered Penetration Tester at TeamRed LLP; he has been in his current post since finishing his undergraduate degree in computing 4 years ago. He is currently working in a team of three to carry out an infrastructure test for a regional supermarket chain; this also entails evaluating one of their mobile web apps.

Ben spends several times a week speaking with an IT team contact to explain on-going progress. Some of this time is spent clarifying whether certain systems are within scope and ascertaining whether certain findings of interest are a cause for concern or not. Ben’s clients know their systems better than him, and will [justifiably] challenge concerns he raises if they don’t think assets are that important. On the other hand, Ben also knows that uneducated clients downplay risk, and blasé clients are often slow or reluctant to make any required changes.

As the project draws, to a close, Ben will consider how best to explain fixes for any problems that are found, but IT teams don’t always like being told what they should do. His experience is that teams distrust his unstructured approach to getting at testing targets and, as a result, is sometimes treated with suspicion and occasional passive-aggressiveness - particularly if any systems fall over during testing, irrespective of whether this has anything to do with testing.
 
#### Attitudes

Ben feels that ethics is an important soft skill. Ben thinks that TeamRed’s code of conduct is largely common sense, but he also knows that unethical behaviour can damage his career should he lose his CREST credentials as a result of an audit by CREST or CESG. Ben realises that any social engineering activities he undertakes can lead to ethical risks given that he is expected to do whatever he has to do to compromise a target; this can include impersonating other people.

Ben finds that working on a testing team can be difficult when the client has commissioned the test because they have to as a box-ticking exercise, rather than because they want to. Such tests are particularly difficult when systems are new and the level of accreditation isn’t clear, or the clients are focused on safeguarding proprietary information above all else. Such clients can also complain because they don’t understand what a penetration test entails, and what everyone’s responsibilities are before, during, and after a penetration test. This can be frustrating to Ben, particularly when his client contact is someone who is not security-savvy or lacks the required authority to action any recommendations made.

While open hostility is rare, Ben often finds his team’s relationship with client IT ‘blue’ team can be frosty at times. During engagements, Ben is proactive in making sure that misunderstandings do not occur due to communication problems. For example, Ben speaks regularly to the IT teams to confirm any expected behaviour during their engagement. While the client’s IT team may not be happy about his team’s presence, he does expect clients to remain professional during testing; this includes ensuring as few people as possible know about any ‘red team’ tests that might be underway, and ensuring that any systems being tested are not modified or made more secure during the testing process.

#### Aptitudes

Ben takes his professional obligations seriously. He is sometimes asked to help with some specific management research or collaborate on white papers. As a result, he has some experience researching attacks from the literature or incident reports raised by colleagues. He keeps track of various news feeds that report new vulnerabilities or threats, and attends internal seminars given by his colleagues on different topics of interest. Together, this research and general awareness of attacks and incidents in the wider community helps Ben understand the perspectives taken by attackers. Where the opportunity avails itself, he shares this perspective when keeping his clients appraised of anything new that might impact a current engagement.

#### Motivations

Ben enjoys looking at problems from the perspective of the black hat. He realises that successful attacks are the product of multiple contributing factors, and is intrigued by the different vectors taken to compromise a target system. As Ben’s experience as grown, the more his security senses have become honed.

Because there is no ‘pen testers guide to ethics’, Ben is motivated by the need to stay within the law. The ease of which laws can be broken is an ever present factor, as are the consequences of a criminal record to his career. For this reason, Ben avoids undertaking any testing which is clearly out of scope or in breach of the Computer Misuse Act, and will double check any technical information provided by clients, such as IP address ranges.

Ben spent time shadowing more senior penetration testers during his initial engagements and watching how they deal with clients during meetings and conference calls. Now his confidence has now grown, Ben has recently became a mentor for a more junior colleague shadowing him on his current project.

#### Skills

By learning from incidents and open source reports about attacks and techniques used, Ben attempts to keep up-to-speed with the tools and technologies of black hats. Ben is not, however, a black hat himself and is conscious of the damage to the pen testing community that might arise if people thought he was. As a result, while Ben is free to choose the testing tools he wants, he generally relies on a toolkit of tried and tested tools and will evaluate the output of any potential new tool before using it on an actual engagement. He makes notes on the usefulness and applicability of any tools he uses and/or customises.

# Narrative

#### Activities


Matt is a director of assurance at TeamRed LLP. He started his career in
IT around 12 years ago and, after some time working for one of the
bigger consultancies moved into penetration testing. He has been CHECK
and CREST accredited but, in recent years, has taken more responsibility
for managing the penetration testing arm of his company.

Matt believes that penetration testing can be a great way of educating
clients about security. He strongly believes that fixing and limiting
the scope of any engagement is a professional obligation, and he has a
moral responsibility to report high impact vulnerabilities as quickly as
possible. Matt hopes that, by demonstrating this level of
professionalism and recommending solid improvements as a result of any
engagement, clients will develop their understanding of penetration
testing as a service.

#### Attitudes

Matt believes that his company’s CREST accreditations are a badge of
trust, and wearing the badge means strictly adhering to the prescribed
code of ethics, upholding high technical and professional standards. Not
maintaining these standards not only undermines client confidence but
the entire pen testing industry.

To start building client confidence, scoping meetings are planned with a
great deal of attention to detail - particularly given the risk of going
out of scope and breaching the CMA. Experience has allowed Matt to get
the gut feeling of possible risks that might be present in a system at an
early stage, so these meetings are used to confirm his understanding,
explain potential threats, and communicate the strategy to be taken when
undertaking the engagement.

When delimiting scope for legal and ethical issues, Matt finds that site
visits are particularly important for red team testers. Red team testing
is highly prized because — within reason — testers are given free reign
to do whatever they have to do to exploit a target. As such, such visits
help testers understand policies that might be in place, understand the
limits of what is and isn’t within scope, and raise any obvious security
issues they find now. Such visits also provide cues for asking the right
questions about any possible ambiguity.

Once an engagement has been concluded then Matt believes responsible
clients should apply any recommendations made as soon as possible. While
Matt acknowledges their recommendations constitute advice not orders, he
also believes that clients fully understand the implications of not
following such as advice. On more than one occasion, Matt has seen
clients compromised because they didn’t act on recommendations given
fast enough.

#### Aptitudes

As important as processes and tools are, Matt believes that experience
is essential when it comes to identifying caveats to testing. Such
caveats may need to be added because information is not made available
to the team, the vulnerability data available is incomplete, or there is
no obvious consensus about what should be within the scope of
engagement.

Matt also feels that the ability to appropriate information is key to a
penetration test’s success. In large projects, testers need to share
information and findings across engagement phases, and any new
vulnerabilities that are found should be shared with everyone that needs
to know about them.

#### Motivations

Managing client expectations is a key motivational driver to Matt, so
much so that testers should be given coaching in this area. Client
relationships should be unbreakable, and clients should feel confident
that any data or vulnerabilities collected are safeguarded, and no
testing goes ahead until both testers and clients share the same
understanding of what the test’s scope is. If, for some reason, these
expectations are not managed then a test’s scope can easily start to
creep, as evidenced by ‘change requests’ related to scope. Fortunately,
as testing progresses, Matt finds that managing these expectations
becomes easier. As these expectations stabilise, scope creep becomes
less likely, and clients gain a better understanding of what content to
expect in the final report, and how to make the engagement work best for
them.

#### Skills

Matt takes the view that ethics should be ‘designed out’ of any
penetration testing practices, such that there should no legal or
ethical dilemmas to face. To this end, assurance is key in the processes
and techniques used by testers. A prescriptive testing methodology is
enforced, and deliverables are quality controlled, such that any
collected data is sanitised and all recommendations made are defensible.
To support this, Matt feels that testing interactions with 3rd parties
should be signed off before any engagement begins.
