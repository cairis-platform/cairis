The current contents of the CAIRIS database can be generated as a requirements specification by selecting the Generate Documentation toolbar button.  After the sections to be included are selected in the Generate Documentation dialog box, the target directory is prompted, following which the specification is generated as HTML, RTF, or PDF, based on the output options selected.
