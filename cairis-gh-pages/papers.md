![fafl102]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fafl102Image.pdf)

The conceptual model upon which CAIRIS is built.


### [Analysing and Visualising Security and Usability in IRIS](http://www.shamalfaily.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/fafl101.pdf)

![fafl101]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fafl101Image.pdf)

How CAIRIS qualitatively and quantitively analyses and visualises the results of risk and task analysis

### [Software for interactive secure systems design: Lessons learned developing and applying CAIRIS](http://www.shamalfaily.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/fafl121.pdf)

![fafl121]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fafl121Image.pdf)

The motivation for building CAIRIS, including a summary of how it was built and evaluated, and some initial experiences applying it to real world case studies.

### [Model-driven architectural risk analysis using architectural and contextualised attack patterns](http://www.shamalfaily.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/faln12.pdf)

![faln12]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/faln12Image.pdf)

Illustrates how architectural and contextualised attack patterns can be used to formalise the elements of architectural attacks and possible defences.

### [Guidelines for integrating personas into software engineering tools](http://www.shamalfaily.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/faly131.pdf)

![faly131]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/faly131Image.pdf)

Four guidelines that software engineering tools should incorporate to support the design and evolution of personas.


### [Eliciting and Visualising Trust Expectations using Persona Trust Characteristics and Goal Models](http://www.shamalfaily.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/fafl142.pdf)

![fafl142]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fafl142Image.pdf)

An approach for eliciting and visualising differences between trust expectations using persona cases, goal models, and CAIRIS.

### [Finding and Resolving Security Misusability with Misusability Cases](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00766-014-0217-8)

![mucImage]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mucImage.pdf)

Illustrates how CAIRIS can help devise scenarios that describe how design decisions lead to usability problems subsequently leading to misuse.

### [Design as Code: Facilitating Collaboration between Usability and Security Engineers using CAIRIS](http://www.shamalfaily.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/faia17.pdf)

![faia17Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/faia17Image.pdf)

Shows how the CAIRIS web app and its models act as a vehicle for collaboration between usability and security engineers.
