<tvtypes>
<vulnerability_type name="Configuration" >
  <description>A vulnerability resulting from an error in the configuration and administration of a system or component.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<vulnerability_type name="Design" >
  <description>A vulnerability inherent in the design or specification of hardware or software whereby even a perfect implementation will result in a vulnerability.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<vulnerability_type name="Implementation" >
  <description>A vulnerability resulting from an error made in implementing software or hardware of a satisfactory design.</description>
</vulnerability_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/DoS and DDoS" >
  <description>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack involves a malicious attempt to disrupt the operation of a computer system or network that is connected to the Internet.  A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a more dangerous evolution of a DoS attack because it utilises a network of compromised zombie computers to mount the attack, so there is no identifiable single source.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Hacking" >
  <description>Hackers want to get into your computer system and use them for their own purposes.  There are many hacking tools available on the internet as well as online communities actively discussing hacking techniques enabling even unskilled hackers to break into unprotected systems.  Hackers have a range of motives; from showing off their technical prowess, to theft of money, credentials or information, to cause damage.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Keystroke logging" >
  <description>Keystroke loggers work by recording the sequence of key-strokes that a user types in.  The more sophisticated versions use filtering mechanisms to only record highly prized information such as email addresses, passwords and credit card number sequences.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Malware" >
  <description>Malware is any program or file that is harmful to a computer, the term covers viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware.  Malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can be used to compromise computers to install DOS zombie programs or other malicious programs.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Electronic/Phishing and Spoofing" >
  <description>Phishing describes a social engineering process designed to trick an organisation's customers into imparting confidential information such as passwords, personal data or banking and financial details.  Most commonly these are criminal attacks but the same techniques could be used by others to get sensitive information.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Insider/Manipulation" >
  <description>Sometimes deliberate attempts are made to acquire information or access by manipulating staff by using a range of influencing techniques.  This is sometimes described as social engineering, creating situations in which someone will willingly provide access to information, sites or systems to someone unauthorised to receive it.  Customer facing personnel who have been trained to be helpful and informative can be particularly vulnerable to such attacks.</description>
</threat_type>
<threat_type name="Insider/Sabotage" >
  <description>Saborage is often committed by a former employee seeking revenge on their employer because of a personal grudge caused by a negative work related event such as dismissal.  Although it is sometimes planned well in advance, it can also be the result of an opportunistic moment.</description>

<project_settings name="ACME Water" >
  <background>The security of the environment around Control Systems, operational personnel, sites, assets, activities, information, technological resources, and services has taken on increased importance at ACME Water for the following reasons:

* The disappearing network boundary: a highly mobile workforce works on assets and systems deployed over a diverse and challenging geographic terrain.  Information Technology enables this but, in doing so, needs to provide controlled access to core applications, allowing multiple protocols access through the perimeter, reducing perimeter controls, allowing partners to deliver contractual obligations on time and to cost.

* The business climate is highly regulated, and delivery of Wastewater and Cleanwater services are critical to our customers.  It is imperative ACME employees are made aware of the importance of protecting our assets, information, and reputation to meet this end.

* Law requires companies to institute reasonable, effective and consistent controls designed to prevent the disclosure and falsification of information, the safety of personnel, sites, and the protection of technological resources.

* Rapid changes face ACME in the use and dependence of computers and network technologies.  It is necessary and reasonable to expect everyone to apply the proper methods of handling and safeguarding information, and managing computer and network resources.</background>

Rick sits down in front of the backup ICT PC, plugs in the USB stick, and copies over the file.  Unknown to Rick, the USB stick also contains malware, which executed after being plugged into the PC, which caused the introduction of a number of malicious DLLs shared with the telemetry service software, changed the account's environment variables and PATH settings.</narrative>

As promised, the certain digits of the pay number double as the gate access code.  After Gareth quickly enters the code, they all enter the site, and make their way towards a remote building; this contains a small pump and a panel PC.  Within a few minutes, the door lock has been broken, and the pump and PC are being carried back to the main gate.

Meanwhile, back in the control room, Rick notices an alarm from the pump in building which had just been burgled.

<usability>
<persona name="Rick" type="Primary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="" >
  <activities>Rick is a clean-water plant operator, responsible for ensuring that water processed through the plant is in line with specified set-points.  Rick's area of responsibility extend outside of the confines of the plant to include checking on pumping stations, which feed water into the plant's nearby reservoir.

 During his working shifts (he works a 5 + 1 continental shift), Rick frequently checks readings on his SCADA workstation, takes water samples at various locations around the plant, and responds to alarms raised by the SCADA system; if necessary this involves investigating problems, and -- if no remedial tasks are possible -- calling someone out to investigate further.

 At the start of every shift, Rick checks AJS to see what work he is scheduled to carry out.  He usually updates AJS based on the work he carried out before the end of his shift.  Rick also maintains a paper work diary, which is updated after carrying out specific work or responding to problems.  This, together with the status white board, is also useful for explaining any on-going issues when handing over to the next shift.  </activities>
  <attitudes>Rick isn't particularly concerned about people trying to hack into the SCADA system he uses.  "The only way the SCADA will get infected", Rick says, "is by an instrument tech plugging a virus infected laptop into it".

 Rick is aware of Information Security communiques on InfoPortal, but doesn't see how this is relevant to him.  "We don't have laptops", says Rick, "and we don't leave site, so we don't leave anything in cars".  Rick is, however, aware of Information Security controls.  Rick knows that logout policies keep intruders from getting access to his workstation (although he thinks the logout period is too short given his environment), and he knows he can only access certain pumping sites via the telemetry system.

 Although Rick can call an instrument tech for many problems, experience has taught him not to expect much from the ACME ICT support during a night shift.  "What's the point of calling up to say you can't login at night if all you get is a reference number", Rick complains, "that won't help me start my pumps now!"  Although Rick knows he can call out an instrument tech to help, he is also conscious that they are out most evenings, and might not appreciate a call-out for a corporate ICT problem.</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Rick has been a plant operator for over 10 years.  Although the exact procedures need to run his plant are documented in a works manual, he doesn't need to refer to it.  "I haven't read the works manual in years", Rick says.

 This experience does not stay in Rick's head. When problems have occurred, he raises these during team meetings, and any lessons learned sometimes find their way into the SCADA system as new functionality.  Rick is aware of the new EnterpriseSCADA developments and possible improvements to the HMI and start-up procedure.  Although not fully in the loop about what is going on, he hopes that, like the current system, there will be productivity improvements without an adverse impact.

 Rick uses the SCADA's trend monitoring facilities as a indication of possible problems.  "If the trends freeze or flat-line", Rick says, "I need to go out and take a look at what's wrong".  Because problems occur daily, and he is often on his own, Rick can still control the plant using panel PCs at remote locations around the plant.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Because the water quality can change over a matter of minutes, Rick's ethos is that you need to be ready for anything.  Because of this, checking certain parameters and pieces of kit is an important discipline, as is logging important events in the works diary and on the status board; these aid communication to other shift members, and the eventual piecing together of the elements of an event.

 Although information security doesn't phase Rick too much, personal security does.  Potentially facing off a scrap metal thief is a big worry for Rick. "The police don't respond to intruder alarms at a nearby pumping station any more due to false alarms", says Rick.  "Because of this, we've been told not to go out to these places on our own.   We have a lone-worker system when people call us when we get to a particular station, but what happens if we get problems on the way?"</motivations>
  <skills>Rick has a basic operating knowledge of Windows; enough to carry out his day-to-day routines, check his email, and navigate the main sections of InfoPortal.

 Rick isn't a power-user; he acknowledges that younger "whizz kids" are much more adept at using PCs than he is.  Consequently, he only uses a sub-set of the desktop icons currently on his desktop.  "I don't know what these other applications do", Rick says,"I've tried clicking on one and it just gives me a Data Protection Warning.  I guess this means I'm not authorised to use it."</skills>

<persona name="Barry" type="Secondary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="" >
  <activities>Much of Barry's work involves equipment modification and instrument calibration; this work arises from requests from Process, or activities as part of on-going projects to improve plant efficiency.  As part of these changes, Barry may need to modify alarms on outstations, and make minor changes to PLCs and HMIs.

Barry is often called out to troubleshoot problems at sites and kiosks within his area of operations in Dorset, which can also involve software changes ranging from simply downloading software to a device to clean up its memory, through to re-generating the software from configuration sheets if no software backup is available.</activities>
  <attitudes>Barry has learned the hard way that you only start learning when things go wrong.  As such, Barry tries to keep up-to-speed with planned SCADA, PLC, and outstation changes as much as possible; he knows that avenues of support may not be easily available in 5-10 years when a piece of equipment is modified, and the associated software needs to change.

If he finds out that some plant modifications are planned in his area, Barry will try to get hold of the relevant work manual; he knows that otherwise he won't be able to get hold of documentation which might be useful in the future.

Although aware of security, Barry is not exceptionally worried about it.  After all, no-one really knows anything about the software he looks after and, in terms of physical security, all the manned site on his patch have security guards. </attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Barry has been using many of his day-to-day software tools almost as long as the tools have been around.  Barry knows quite a bit about telemetry software, so often gets called up by the more junior instrument techs to deal with any telemetry issues.  Conversely, Barry is less experienced with some of the SCADAs in use, so is reliant on people working in plants, or other colleagues, for any detailed troubleshooting.

Due to the lack of ACME ICT support for PC hardware at his site, Barry has learned how to backup his site PCs, his personal laptop, and recover from PC hardware failures - a significant problem given the age of some of the PCs in his area.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Barry gets annoyed when he needs to make a software change at a remote site, and finds that he can't get at the software he needs from a PLC or outstation, can't trust the on-site backup left behind or the software on his laptop.</motivations>
  <skills>Barry doesn't have any specific experience of software repositories or version control.  He does, however, have lots of experience archiving and restoring PLC and telemetry software.</skills>

Rick leaves the control room and heads down to the loading area.  Once there, he supervises the delivery.  After 20 minutes, the Chlorine delivery has been unloaded and signed for, and Rick heads back to the control room.  When he gets back, he sits down and note the time of the Chlorine delivery in the works diary.</narrative>

After logging into TMSview, he finds the location of a pumping station 10 miles upstream on the map and connects to it.  After a few moments, he masters the main pump before switching it off.  Rick then returns the pump to its normal slave setting before shutting down TMSview.  The alarm periodically starts and stop again but, after about an hour, the reservoir level normalises again.</narrative>

Rick leaves the control room building, and walks to the building where the offending inlet pump lives.  Once he gets there, he doesn't see anything obviously wrong, so he checks the MCC to see if there has been some sort of trip.  Again, Rick can't find anything amiss with the electrics, so he concludes there must be some sort of communications problem.

Rick returns back to the control room, and calls up one of the instrument techs located in a building on the other side of the site.  After Rick explains the problem and puts the phone down, he stops the alarm and notes his actions so far in the works diary.  After the 15 minutes, Rick gets a phone call.  As he picks the phone up, he notices that trends have returned to normal again.  Barry explains that there was a minor fault due to a spurious PLC setting, but everything is back to normal again.  After this call, Rick again notes the event in the works diary.</narrative>

    <narrative>Rick looks at the SCADA terminal and notices one of the inlet pumps appears to have failed.  Because Rick is the only person currently on site, Rick leaves the control room building, locking all the doors behind him, and walks to the building where the offending inlet pump lives.  Once he gets there, he doesn't see anything obviously wrong, so he checks the MCC to see if there has been some sort of trip.  Again, Rick can't find anything amiss with the electrics, so he concludes there must be some sort of communications problem.

Rick returns back to the control room, and calls up the bunker at Dorchester.  He describes the problem, and asks for a stand-by instrument tech to be called out to take a look.  After Rick puts the phone down, he stops the alarm and notes his actions so far in the works diary.  After an hour, Rick glances up at the CCTV camera and notices a white transit van approaching, after stopping at the gate for a few moments, the electrified gate opens up and the van drives through.  This van is driven by Barry, an instrument tech who is a frequent visitor to the site.  After a few minutes, Rick hears the buzzer for the main entrance to the building, after hearing Barry's voice, Rick buzzes Barry in.  When Barry gets to the control room and exchanges a few pleasantries, Rick explains the problem to Barry, who heads down to the inlet pump building.

Fifteen minutes later, Barry arrives back at the control room and explains there was a minor fault due to a spurious PLC setting, but everything is back to normal again.  Rick glances over to the SCADA terminal and notices that the trends are indeed back to normal.  After Barry leaves, Rick notes the event in the works diary.</narrative>

    <narrative>Before Barry reaches the site, he speaks to Rick to discuss the job requirements.  As soon as Barry has this understanding, he downloads the latest changes to his laptop and makes the necessary PLC software modifications.

Barry walks over to the panel which accesses the PLC needing to be modified.  Barry then starts up his laptop.  Barry checks the version of his software matches that which is on the PLC.  This comparison is carried using Step 7.  Following this, Step 7 is used to download the software modifications to the PLC.

After downloading, Barry carries out a number of site operation checks to commision the software; this involves taking the piece of equipment out of service in order to make sure the plant operates.  These checks involve co-ordination with Rick.

After the site operations check, Barry backs up the software.  Finally, Barry speaks to Rick to make sure he is happy with the changes made.  Barry then closes the job down using his hand-held.</narrative>

After downloading, Barry carries out a high level check on the site to validate the software download was successful.  This check involves co-ordinating with Rick.

Finally, Barry checks that Rick is happy with the work carried out.  Barry then retrospectively creates the job, and backs up the software.</narrative>
