      CAIRIS supports the association of assets, inconsistency checking between associated assets, and visualisation of asset models.
      					<p>The CAIRIS asset model is based on UML class models. Asset models can be viewed for each defined environment. As well as explicitly defined asset associations, 
      					asset models will also contain associations implicitly defined. For example, if a task has been defined, and this task concerns within an environment contain one or 
      					more assets, then the participating persona will be displayed as an actor, and an association between this actor and the asset will be displayed. Additionally, 
      					if concern associations have been defined between goals and assets and/or associations then zooming into the model will display these concerns; the concerns are 
      					displayed as blue comment elements.</p>

      <div class="panel-body">In CAIRIS, a requirements specification is analogous to a safety case. In a safety case, a system is only considered safe if its safety goals have been satisfied
      . 
      <p> In a similar manner, requirements are leaf nodes in a goal tree and satisfying stakeholder needs is only possible if the high-level goals – stipulated by stakeholders – 
      can be satisfied.</p>
      
      <p>We define goals as prescriptive statements of system intent that are achievable by one or more agents. Goals can be refined to requirements, which are achievable by only agent. Goals and requirements may also be operationalised 
      as tasks. Alternatively, we may decide to specify tasks and ask what goals or requirements need to hold in order that a given task can be completed successfully.</p>
		<p>To satisfy a goal, one or more sub-goals may need to be satisfied; satisfaction may require satisfying a conjunction of sub-goals, i.e. several AND goals, or a disjunction of sub-goals, i.e. several OR goals.</p>      					
      <p>Goals or requirements may be obstructed by obstacles, which are conditions representing undesired behaviour; these prevent an associated goal from being achieved. By progressively refining obstacles, we can obtain the origin of some undesired behaviour; this may be reflected as a vulnerability or 
      a threat, and contribute to risk analysis.</p>
