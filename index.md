      <h2>What is CAIRIS?</h2>
      <p>CAIRIS stands for Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security. It is a platform for eliciting, specifying, and validating secure and usable systems. It was built from the ground up to support all the elements necessary for usability, requirements, and risk analysis.</p>

      <li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
        <h3>What does CAIRIS do that other tools do not?</h3>
        <p>Some tools focus on the specification of requirements. Others focus on modelling threats. Still, others are centred around managing UX data. CAIRIS is the only tool that does all of this (and more).
CAIRIS is also the only security design tool that supports the notion of environments, making it possible to model contexts of use.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="icon fa-heart-o">
        <h3>Is CAIRIS free?</h3>
        <p>Yes. CAIRIS has been made freely available under an Apache Software License.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="icon fa-laptop">
        <h3>Why do I need CAIRIS?</h3>
        <p>We expect security to be 'built in' software, but software is useless if people can't or won't use it.  We built CAIRIS to support the activities need to build security AND usability into the earliest stages of software design.  Additionally, by using CAIRIS as the repository for data you collect, you benefit from CAIRIS' automatic analysis and visualisation capabilities.</p> 
      </li>	

      <li class="icon fa-flag-o">
        <h3>Can I see CAIRIS in action?</h3>
        <p>We have a <a href="https://demo.cairis.org">live demo</a> where you can play with two preloaded models.</p>
