      <h2>What is CAIRIS?</h2>
      <p>CAIRIS stands for Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security. It is a platform for eliciting, specifying, and validating secure and usable systems. It was built from the ground up to support all the elements necessary for usability, requirements, and risk analysis.</p>

        <h3>What does CAIRIS do that other tools do not?</h3>
        <p>Some tools focus on the specification of requirements. Others focus on modelling requirements together with related concepts. Still, others are centred around managing UX data. CAIRIS is the only tool that does all of this (and more).
CAIRIS is also the only security design tool that supports the notion of environments, making it possible to model contexts of use.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="icon fa-heart-o">
        <h3>Is CAIRIS free?</h3>
        <p>Yes. CAIRIS has been made freely available under an Apache Software License.</p>
      </li>

      <li class="icon fa-laptop">
        <h3>Why do I need CAIRIS?</h3>
        <p>CAIRIS helps by supporting the usability, security, and requirements engineering activities that one might use at the initial stages of a project. If you’re undertaking these activities then you’re collecting data that needs to go somewhere. By using CAIRIS as a repository for this data, you will benefit from CAIRIS’ automatic analysis and visualisation capabilities.</p>
      </li>	

      <li class="icon fa-flag-o">
